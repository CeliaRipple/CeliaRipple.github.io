In this lab we accessed data about Dar es Salam from the Resilience Academy from Ramani Huria to do a vulnerability
anaylsis for Dar es Salam. 

We used PostGres SQL to process our data for analysis and QGIS to visualize the outputs.

My partner and I chose to look at the density of storm drains by subward to examine how something like storm drain 
infrastructure can affect vulnerability to floods.  
our analysis used data on the storm drains as points from the Resilence Academy.
subward divsions also obtained from Reilience Academy. 
We also used data from Open Street Map to look at the wetlands extent. 
Our final drain density map with the wetlands extent can be found here:
