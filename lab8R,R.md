Over the course of lab weeks 7 and 8, our class looked at problems of reproducibility and replicability 
in geography. We focused on a paper titled "Vulnerability Modeling for Sub-saharan Africa: an Operationalized 
Approach in Malawi" published by Malcomb, Weaver, and Krakowka. We read through the paper and tried to recreate 
their findings from the information the paper provided in the methods section. We ran into some immediate problems
with the idea of a vulnerability analysis. Jochen Hinkel argues that there is not real way to measure vulnerability 
because there is so much spatial heterogenity that factors into vulnerability analysis and the real impacts of 
vulnerability cannot be easily measured nor should they be confused with measurements of harm. This point speaks to 
a greater issue about the challenges of reproducing qualitative data. Malcomb et al. determined
that vulnerability could be described in terms of resilience and adaptive capacity which they decided was determined
by a household's assets and access to resources. The factors that malcomb et al. used to determine adaptive capacity and 
thus vulnerability were determined from surveys of people living in Malawi. 

With factors determined, Malcomb et al. used data from DHS survey years 2004 and 2010 to assess assets and access at the household
level. We were able to gain access to this data and used in our reproduction of the results. However, we ran into an issue with 
access to data because in addition to using the DHS surveys, Malcomb et al. used FEWSNET 2005 data to determine livlihood sensitivity 
which we did not have access to. FEWSNET 2005 data accounted for 20% of the final vulnerability anaylsis, so even if we did 
everything else that Malcomb et al. did, our results will only ever be 80% complete. 

Using the data that we had we ran through an analysis of the data based on the medthods section of the Malcomb et al. paper. 
Malcomb et al. assigned a vulnerability score from 1-5 to each household based on the vulnerability indicators chosen for 
the study. The indicators from the DHS data was categorized uder adaptive capacity which was further broken down into assests, 
access. Malcomb et al. determined that assests and access factors each contributed 20% to the over all vulnerability (40% together). 
20% of the vulnerability was attributed to livelihood sensitivity (FEWSNET data) that we did not have access to. And the final
40% was attributed to physical exposure which was subdivided into "Estimated Risk for Flood Hazard" and "Exposition to Drought Events"
Each of which were given 20% contribution to vulnerability. The data for the phyiscal exposure came from the UNEP Global Risk Data
Platform (GRID). We also downloaded this data for our anaylsis.
