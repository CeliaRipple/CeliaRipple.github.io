This is a visualization of the steps for week 3 lab
step 1: 
after importing the DEMs into the saga they will look like this [Demsnotmosaiced](DEMfilesASTER.png)
The DEMs need to be mosaiced together to create one seemless DEM. The Mosaicking tool lives under Grid> gridding> Mosaicking
After the DEMS have been mosaicked they will look like this [DEMSmosaic](MosaicmapASTER.png)
Step 2:
The DEMs are now mosaicked together, but they are in WGS84. We need to reproject into World Mercator.
to do this go to the projection tab under tools the to Proj.4 then to UTM projection (Grid). 
The >>source is now the layer that was created from the DEMs that we mosaicked together.
execute this step. Now the layers will be in World Mercator. 
Step 3: 
Next to create a hillshade, go to the tools and under the Terrain Analysis tab go to Lighting, visibility then to Analytical 
Hillshading. The output will look like this [Hillshade](
