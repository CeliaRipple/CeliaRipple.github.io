# Urban Geo big data blog post 
## Header 2
### Header 3
The Urban Geo Big Data project used open source materials to examine the issues of urban mobility, soil consumption, and displacement in Italian cities. The article states that the surplus of geospatially referenced data is growing, and that the Geo Big Data project’s aim is to create systems to best handle that data and make it accessible at lost cost to city planners and administrators. To preserve the low cost of information output, it appears necessary that this be an open source project. This is exemplified in the article’s explanation of building 3D city models. CityGML was used in the Geo Big Data project, but that since the beginning of the project CityJON has improved upon existing technology to create better 3D mapping. Because of open source, future projects will have access to CityJON for 3D mapping. 
The mobility project used ITS (intelligent transportation systems) and FCD (floating car data) to form a data basis. This data was used to map the mobility patterns in Turin which has practical applications for city planners looking at issues of traffic congestion and equal city access. Soil consumption project used radar images over time to map the changes in artificial and inartificial land cover over time. Displacement data was gathered Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar. The descriptions of the projects highlighted some of their potential uses and well as outlining the limitations in data collections.
