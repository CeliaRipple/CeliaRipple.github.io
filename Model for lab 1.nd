Description of model for first lab:
the model used in this lab allows the user to find the direction and the distance from a point created on the existing layer or 
another layer to other points on the layer. The model uses the centroid fuction to convert polygons into points so that distance and 
direction can be calucualted from the center of that polygon to the origin point. The model allows the user to also calculate their 
own origin point nonspecific to one polygon to calculate direction and distance from, by finding a mean of centrroids from multiple polygons. 
An added feature allows the user to create original names for output fields.
